excerpt: Play as a deer in a mystical forest with other deer. You start off as a fawn and then grow up into a deer with antlers that you can decorate. You can only communicate with others through body language and deer calls. This game is more an artistic expression than a game, and the deer have human faces, giving them an uncanny but memorable vibe.
